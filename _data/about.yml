    - title: About Me
      details: I am a software engineer from Florida with a focus on Linux and Open Source software. My current technical focus is on C programming and kernel/embedded development. I have years of experience and like to deal with backend software development, DevOps, the design of system architectures, and the transfer of technical knowledge. I have a strong knowledge of how modern computer systems work and how they donâ€™t work. I have deep extensive Linux knowledge, a sound understanding of Computer Science concepts, and knowledge of bringing DevOps and Cloud practices to life.
