Its been quite some time since I've upgraded my "home lab". I have posted about going from building gaming and customer 
pc's from scratch to shrinking my home lab to smaller workstations. As of 2022 I have definitely changed alot of my workstations. 
After talking to my wife and ordering parts my current lab looks, as she likes to call it, a mission control station. 
My current homelab consists of a 7th gen Lenovo Thinkpad X1carbon which is starting to show its age. Its been a while since I had a Desktop 
and with all the new changes, like my daughter, I decided to become more stationary and build a new desktop. With the Thinkpad and the macbook pro 
provided from work I felt the need to start selling the Thinkpad and building out my new workstation. I like the Idea of starting small and building 
from there. Here is a current list of what I am calling my 2022 build. With the inflation of GPU's due to bitcoin mining, scripted trading bots, and cryptocurrency
I decided to hold off an on GPU for now and see if the integrated graphics are strong enought to play the small games I play like Deaths Door, Blasphemous, and possibly 
the new Guilty Gear, King of Fighters, or (i'm hoping) Street Fighter V on low settings. The RAM will  be upgraded to max out the usage so I can start playing 
with microk8's and more docker images without issue soon enough. So, for anyone who is intereted. Here is a list of my unfinished build.
